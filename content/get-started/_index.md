# Getting Started with Hajj and Umrah

Welcome to our guide on embarking on the sacred journeys of Hajj and Umrah! Here’s everything you need to know to get started.

## What is Hajj?

Hajj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and a mandatory religious duty for Muslims who are physically and financially capable. Performed during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah, Hajj involves specific rites that symbolize unity, humility, and devotion to Allah.

## What is Umrah?

Unlike Hajj, Umrah can be performed at any time of the year. It is also a pilgrimage to Mecca but involves fewer rituals. Although not mandatory, Umrah holds significant spiritual value and serves as an act of worship and purification.

## Differences Between Hajj and Umrah

- **Timing**: Hajj is performed during specific dates, while Umrah can be done anytime.
- **Rituals**: Hajj is more comprehensive, involving additional rituals.
- **Obligation**: Hajj is obligatory for eligible Muslims once in their lifetime, whereas Umrah is voluntary.

## How to Prepare

1. **Spiritual Preparation**: Engage in prayer, study the rites, and prepare mentally and spiritually.
2. **Physical Preparation**: Ensure good health and stamina for the journey.
3. **Documentation**: Secure visas, tickets, and accommodations.
