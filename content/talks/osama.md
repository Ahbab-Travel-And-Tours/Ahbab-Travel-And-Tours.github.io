# About Me:
I am currently a Computer Engineering student at Air University, Islamabad. I am passinate about building websites in an easy way. In the world of wordpress and what not I think aiming for minimal bloat/dependencies is the most sane way to navigate this complex world of tech otherwise you get in a deep rabbit hole of trying to figure out various technologies and how to glue all of them together to make a working mess.
